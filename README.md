# DMML-CW3
My entry for Coursework 3 of the 2017 Data Mining and Machine Learning Class, involving the use of Bayes networks and clustering with Weka. The experiments performed for the report can be repeated by running the `main` functions in each of the task classes located in src/main/tasks.


## Requirements
This is a Kotlin project, so you will need to use a compatible IDE or the Kotlin compiler to run the various files - please see <http://kotlinlang.org/> for details. Dependency management is done through Gradle but the only requirement is Weka so feel free to add it in another way if you prefer. If you want Gradle to handle it, run
`gradle build`.
